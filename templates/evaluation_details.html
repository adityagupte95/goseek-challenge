<p>
    Agents are evaluated on a weighted sum of four criteria for each episode:
    1) The recall (r) of finding target fruit when the agents selects the collect action,
    2) precision (p) of finding target fruit when the agent selects the collect action,
    3) the number of collisions (c) with objects in the scene, and
    4) actions (a) taken in the episode before all target fruit are collected or time expires.
</p>

<p>
    A single episode score is r + 0.1p - 0.1c/l - 0.1a/l where l is the maximum episode length (400). Note that an episode terminates early if all fruit are collected.

    We use Monte Carlo evaluations to estimate an average episode score for the competition. Note that evaluations occur on withheld office scenes.
